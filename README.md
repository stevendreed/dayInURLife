### Description
>
> This application is a frontend only application that allows a user to build out their own workday planner! Entries persist
> after a refresh of the browser by leveraging `localStorage`, which allows a user to view their last plan and implement that
> same plan on future workdays.
>
> The primary technology used is [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), which is an HTML document traversal & event handling JavaScript
> library. jQuery is an excellent addition to this project because it allowed for very simple creation of HTML elements & adding
> children to those elements with ease.
>
> One of the motivating reasons for creating this project was to give me a chance to play with jQuery more. While vanilla `JS`
> and standard [Document Object Model](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp) navigation are robust, jQuery exepdites
> development time because of `jQuery` member function overloading. I was super happy to see how much easier it was to render
> elements dynamically due to the plethora of features that jQuery ships with!
>
> For future development, I have a huge list of ideas to bring this product past the minimum viable product:
#### Future Development
- Allow the user to increment/decrement the workday range
- Auto-refresh which time bands are past, present, or future (rather than on page load like I have)
- `Clear` and `Save all` buttons
- `Export` feature to store all data as a JSON
- Full calendar integration, allowing a user to navigate to different dates to update their planner for each date & export
as events to Google Calendar
